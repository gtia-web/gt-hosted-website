                                        Assistant at a lab, either for pay or for academic credit. Students can also
                                        apply for the President’s Undergraduate Research Award. See more information

                                        team-based context. Undergraduate VIP students earn academic credits, while
                                        faculty and graduate students benefit from the design/discovery efforts of their
                                        teams. See more information <a
