<!-- Class Registration -->
<section id="registration">
<h2 id="registration">Class Registration</h2>
The Course Scheduling at Georgia Tech is a process that spans one-two months. The schedule of classes for any
semester becomes available online on <a href="https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/buzzport">BuzzPort</a> one semester before the actual
semester. For instance, the schedule of classes offered in the Fall and Summer become available for viewing in the
first few weeks of March. These courses also get added to Courseoff. After, two-three weeks, every student is
assigned a time ticket based on his/her academic standing based on credit hours. Registration begins approximately
five days after time tickets have been assigned. There are two phases of registration- Phase 1 and Phase 2 with the
latter occurring after a gap of two months. This time period can be used for further planning of schedules and
getting overloads and permits. Some classes have major restrictions on them during Phase-1, however can be registered
for during Phase 2. Registration is also done using Buzzport. Here are some useful tools that students could use to
help them with class selection and the registration process: <br /><br />
<div class="12u">
    <ul>
		<li><a href="https://gatech.courseoff.com/">Courseoff</a> is an online website that enables
			students to plan their schedules ahead of registration and simplifies the registration process.
			Besides offering a color coded scheme for various classes, it enables the students to select any
			particular class offered in the current/future semester, view the timings and class capacity, Professors
			teaching those classes and the course CRNs.</li>
        <li>Students can also view the reviews and ratings of different Professors for multiple subjects based on
			student feedback from <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=760458">RateMyProfessor
			</a> and <a href="https://critique.gatech.edu">Course Critique</a>. Course Critique also has information
			regarding class sizes and grade distribution for different courses over a span of 5-10 years. These sites
			should only be used as a tool during the planning process as they are neither comprehensive nor portray
			any Professor accurately.</li>
