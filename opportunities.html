                        We know college can be expensive, which is why we have various on-campus job opportunities for
                        our students.
                        Along with that career opportunities in the form of jobs, internships,study abroad etc. are an
                        excellent way to
                        display oneâ€™s talent and interest to potential employers- which is what the Center for Career
                        Discovery and
                        Development works on, bridging the gap between employers and Georgia Tech students. <br/><br/>

                                                interning in the US have to register their internship with the school
                                                (obtain CPT/OPT). See (g) for more information regarding international
