Along with that career opportunities in the form of jobs, internships,study abroad etc. are an excellent way to
display oneâ€™s talent and interest to potential employers- which is what the Center for Career Discovery and
Development works on, bridging the gap between employers and Georgia Tech students. <br /><br />
