                        Contrary to popular belief, Tech student life expands beyond just the rigorous study and hours
                        of research.
                        Here’s what Tech has to offer to the non-academic aspect of student life. <br/><br/>

                                Georgia Tech has over 400
                                student organizations that cater to the interests of its diverse student body. Engage is
                                a website where you can find a description of each organization and the contact details
                                for its Executive Board.

                                Approximately 37% of our student population is Greek, which means they are affiliated
                                with a sorority or fraternity. Greek organizations serve a social purpose and act as a
                                strong community for those involved.

                                There are a wide variety of organizations centered around sports. Teams play at
                                different levels (intramurals, varsity etc.) and many do not require any prior
                                experience to join! You can learn more here about Georgia Tech’s formal Athletics

                                A FLO is a freshmen-led organization with strong GT departmental connections that seeks
                                to better the Georgia Tech community through a unique program that enriches the
                                first-year experience for its members and the entire freshman class. Joining a FLO is an
                                opportunity to get involved in leadership positions early on in your Georgia Tech
                                career. Here are the current FLO programs available:

                                Georgia Tech takes pride in its diverse student body. Joining a cultural organization
                                can also help students find community and feel a sense of belonging in our large
                                university. The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and India Club are currently
                                two of the biggest cultural organizations at Tech that celebrate their respective
                                regional cultures.

                                Interested in joining GTIA? We recruit new ambassadors every Fall and Spring, so look
                                out for our application during the beginning of each semester!

                                Many organizations also have an academic and/or professional focus. These organizations
                                allow you to obtain valuable experience in an area you might want to work in later on.
                                Some notable ones include Engineers Without Borders (EWB), Bits of Good, Undergraduate
                                Research Ambassadors, Consult Your Community, and Student Competition Center Teams.
                                However there are many more that cater to a very wide variety of interests.
