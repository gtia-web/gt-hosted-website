						Our community restaurants are:

						<div class="12u">
							<ul>
								<li>North Avenue (near North Avenue Apartments)</li>
								<li>Brittain (near Brown and Smith residence halls)</li>
								<li>West Village (near Freeman, Fulmer, and Fitten residence halls)</li>
							</ul>
							North Avenue and Brittain are traditional dining halls with an “all you can eat” option,
							while West Village consists of several mini-restaurants that serve different cuisines.
							<br/><br/>
							The Student Center houses a food court and a couple of retail dining stores including
							Chick-fil-A, Subway, and Panda Express.
							<br/><br/>
							Pro Tip: Use the Grubhub app to order food from these restaurants in advance so you can
							avoid waiting in long lines!
							<br/><br/>
							You can purchase food at these restaurants using cash or dining dollars (see below). In
							addition, there are a few restaurants (ex. Auditions, Southern Kitchen) here where you can
							use meal swipes to get a combo.

						<a

						<br/><br/>

						<hr/>
						<h2 id="delivery">Delivery Options</h2>
						Services such as Uber Eats, Grubhub, and Doordash are used frequently on campus. There
						are also services that deliver home-cooked Indian and Chinese food to campus for pickup.
						Each of these services have their own group chats, in which you can join to place orders

						<hr/>
						<h2 id="meal_plan">Meal Plans</h2>
						All incoming first-year students that decide to live in on-campus housing are required to
						purchase a meal plan.

						If you join Greek Life, you must purchase the Greek meal plan (Greek 100).

						If you are second-year or above, there is a wider variety of meal plans that you can purchase to
						suit your needs.

						More details about the different kinds of plans can be found <a

						<h2 id="meal_swipes">Meal Swipes</h2>
						Meal swipes can be used at any of the community restaurants (Brittain, North Avenue, West
						Village). You can also use these at certain restaurants in the Student Center to purchase a
						combo meal. Meal swipes expire at the end of each semester.
						<br/><br/>

						<hr/>
						<h2 id="dd">Dining Dollars</h2>
						Dining dollars are loaded onto your Buzzcard, and can be used at any on-campus dining option.
						Dining dollars are tax-exempt. At the end of the Spring semester, any unused dining dollars
						expire.
						<br/><br/>
